What?
=====

Prints QR-Codes on the terminal.

Why?
====

I want to use it to connect [geth](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) and [WallETH](https://walleth.org) via the [wallet connect](https://walletconnect.org) protocol.

How?
====

It uses [zxing](https://github.com/zxing/zxing) and is inspired by [qrcode-terminal](https://github.com/gtanner/qrcode-terminal)
